## Running
Running the app requires [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/). To run execute the following command:
```
stack run
```
You will be asked to provide two paths: one to a file containing Shoenfield machine code, and the second one containing initial register values. Some example files are provided in the `machines` and `inputs` folders.
